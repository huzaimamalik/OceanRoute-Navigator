🌊 OceanRoute Navigator
Maritime Route Planning & Optimization System (SFML C++ Project)

OceanRoute Navigator is an SFML-powered interactive maritime simulation that visualizes global shipping routes, computes optimal paths using Dijkstra/A*, performs multi-leg journey planning, simulates port docking queues, and animates ship movement across a world map using sprite-based surfing motions.

This project combines Data Structures & Algorithms, SFML graphics, and simulation elements into a complete maritime logistics tool.
